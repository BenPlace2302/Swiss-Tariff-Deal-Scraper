# Swiss-Tariff-Deal-Scraper
Code that scrapes bloomberg and reuters rss feeds to find if a tariff deal has been reached between the US and Switzerland. Then, to emulate paper trading, takes the current stock price for Richemont when a trade deal has been reached to investigate how it changes soon after the news breaking. We take Richemont as it has a large exposure to the US and currently the Swiss have a 39% tariff, including luxury watches. The code runs every 30 seconds to minimise background usage. We could also change this code to find if Trump follows through with the threat of high tariffs for pharamceuticals (which are currently exempt), and investigate how much US-exposed pharma companies like Roche Holdings will decrease after such a deal.
